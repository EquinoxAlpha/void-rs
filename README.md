# void-rs

Minimal Minecraft server (limbo) implementation in Rust, for authentication on a server that I am working on.

As of right now, the code is a complete mess, and not intended for external usage. If you are looking for a server implementation with relatively little dependencies (remove SurrealDB) to hack upon, then feel free to clone this repository.

Supports Minecraft 1.19.2 clients (protocol version 760)

Intended to be ran behind a Velocity proxy.
